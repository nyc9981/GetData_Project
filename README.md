### Coursera "*Getting And Cleaning Data*" Course Project
***
This is the repo for the Coursera *Getting and Cleaning Data* class project . This project is to collect, work with, clean a data set, and finally make a tidy data set ready for further analysis. The project includes a README.md (this file), a CookBook.md, and an R script called run_analysis.R.  For the detailed description of the data, variables, and any transformations or work that are performed to clean up the data, please see CodeBook.md. The script run_analysis.R performs all the following necessary steps to make a tidy data set.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
